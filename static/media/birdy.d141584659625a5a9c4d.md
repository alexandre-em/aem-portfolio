## Login section

The `user`insert his login `id` and `password`. Before it sends to the table `estConnecte` of the SQL table, we check if they are valid by sending a request to the table `utilisateurs`. the `id` is stored as a String and the password as a blob so we can't see the password without the a secret key. When the `user` logout or when the user is inactive, it will be remove from the table `estConnecte`.
